      <p><img src="" alt="" width="" height="" class="flowLeft">In this website I’ll be talking about and showcasing the pets I have in my home. All together we have 3. One dog that we’ve had since I was little and recently 2 new additions in the form of two kitties. Even though my dog doesn’t like Cats they still all get along just fine even if it was difficult at first. Eventually they got used to each other and can coexist even if they aren’t friends.

      <p>Everyone in my family is allergic to cats to some degree. I’ve got it the worst but even then I still welcomed them into my home and even named one. My allergies have gotten better over time but I still have to be careful with touching them and then touching my eyes as I can get really itchy and puffy all over my eyes. Its not as bad as others peoples cats though, probably because I’ve gotten used to them over time.

      Its really fun to watch them play during the day and since they are kittens still they have so much energy when they are awake and about. Although, my dog sort of avoids them when they get too close, haha.</p>
