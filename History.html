      <p><img src="" alt="" width="" height="" class="flowLeft">Over the years we've had a lot of pets in our family but the one that we've had the longest is Rocky, our current dog. In the past we had 2 other dogs and some fish. Since it was when I was younger I don't remember them too well and my parents were the ones who took care of them for the most part.</p>

      <p>Our first dog we ever had we named Lucky and we got him as a puppy. Two months in he escaped through a hole in the fence and was hit by the neighors car. We had to put him down as he couldn't live long with his injuries. And our second dog we had for 5 years. He was also named Lucky but one day he also escaped and even though we searched and searched for him we never found him. 

      After that we stopped getting pets for our family. This was until I started going to middle and pleaded with my parents to let me get a dog and this dog was Rocky. We've had Rocky for a really long time now and hes going on 10 years old. Only until recently did we get the new additions of our two kitties named Lily and Lilo. It was my brother this time that really wanted a cat and while we were there we decided to get both of the sisters together so they have eachother to play with.</p>
