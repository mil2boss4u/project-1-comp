      <p><img src="" alt="" width="" height="" class="flowLeft">Now for my cats. We've had them for 3 months now and got them when they were 3 months old. My Moms coworker tolder her that her cat had birth and that they were giving away the kittens to people with good homes if she was interested. Originally she was the one that wanted the cat but when my brother heard about it he decided that it would be his cat which works out cause hes helps a lot with taking care of them, as well do I.</p>

      <p>Like I've said, everyone in my family is allergic to cats to some degree but we've gotten more used to it over the months. At first they were really suspicious of use and would somestimes go hide under the bed but after the first month they finally started sleeping with us and looking for us around the house. I was the one that named Lily and my brother named Lilo. I was supposed to sleep with Lily but I sprained my ankle and wasn't able to walk for a month and a half so keeping a litter box for them was impossible and since then they've been with my brother most nights.

      <br>
      Watching them play is super intertaining and suprising because of how rough they can get but I can understand since they are siblings. Another suprising thing is that while Lily doesn't mind seeing strangers in the house, Lilo gets terrified and hides under the bed until everyone leaves. Even if I hold her she still runs away and fights you if you hold her while trying to get close to strangers. Even then they love to cuddle and like to find me in my room and sleep with me in the foot of my bed. I'm happy he got them and so is the rest of my family.</p>
