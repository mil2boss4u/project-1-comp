      <p><img src="" alt="" width="" height="" class="flowLeft">We've had Rocky in our family for a really long time now and he's going on 10 years. I bought him for 60 dollars from a family friend when I was going to start middle school. He's gotten out a couple times from the house but he returns now and just waits outside for someone to let him in.</p>

      <p>We've never really had any problems with Rocky except for him getting out sometimes. One time he got out and a couple of ladies chased him trying to found out if he had an owner from his collar but he kept running and wouldn't let them touch him. 

      He's really antisocial and doesn't like to socialize with other dogs unfortuantely but at least he doesn't try to fight them or bark loudly at them when we go for walks and stuff. I take him on hikes and walks daily and he just loves getting out there. I have a routine of taking him out in the morning before I head to school and he just follows me around all morning waiting for me to take him outside which is really funny. The only issue is that he sheds so much every single day but my family has gotten used to it by now.</p>
